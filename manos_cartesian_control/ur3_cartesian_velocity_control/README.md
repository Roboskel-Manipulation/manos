# A Cartesian Velocity controller interface

This package utilizes a cartesian velocity controller hardware interface for Manos (Roboskel's UR3) and is based on [this controller](https://github.com/epfl-lasa/ridgeback_ur5_controller/tree/devel/ur5_cartesian_velocity_control).

It accepts 6D (linear and angular) velocities expressed in the `base_link` frame
